# NativeInstall
Open source program for mounting .iso files from Native Instruments, as well as keeping track of installations.
This is a work in progress, so most of the functionalities are not implemented yet.

NativeInstall is an application I created to keep help of tracking installations of the Native Instruments plugins.
When using wine with Native Access, the program fails to install plugins. Instead, it downloads the .iso image from the internet,
which the user has to then install manually using the terminal.

This application does the task of mounting the files and saving the installations to the user history, which will be implemented soon.
The task left to the user is to drive the .exe files from the mounted folder using wine.
